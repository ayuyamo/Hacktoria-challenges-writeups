# Naval Intrusion Challenge

- Task: Given an image, identify the naval vessel and its NATO reporting name

## Solution

- A google reverse image search will show results pointing to this naval vessel being most likely a type 054a frigate with NATO codename `Jiangkai II` from the People's Republic of China operated by People's Liberation Army Navy (lots of similar characteristics). We can further confirm this from the details given in the instruction pdf, which notes its sighting near southwestern territorial boundary of Taiwan regional waters and possibly near the Paracel Islands - areas this type of vessel would commonly be observed.
- answer: `type-054a-jiangkai-II`
