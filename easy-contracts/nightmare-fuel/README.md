## Quick summary of the task

```
Greetings Special Agent K.

Yesterday evening around 2100 hours, two NYPD officers entered an abandoned building in Brownsville following neighbor complaints about a squatting woman and strange noises.

What drew NYPD’s attention was security footage showing multiple people entering the building but never leaving, despite all windows being sealed and only one entrance under surveillance.

During their search, officers spotted someone at the end of a hallway who retreated behind a door. When they approached, they briefly saw a woman move past the doorframe. Despite commands, she disappeared completely.

A subsequent sweep by twelve officers and a K-9 unit found no one – not even a scent trail.

Most concerning, the body cam footage is missing audio entirely. We need you to analyze this video and determine what happened.

As always, Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

This is a pretty easy task, as checking the comment section in the metadata of the image (which you could extract using online tools or in my case, the command-line tool `exiftool`) or check the properties (under details) by double-clicking on the video will reveal the string of characters that are the answer to the task.

Final answer: `fh453n3fk45b384gm$&%#fjksdfmo94853ff`
